**!!DISCLAIMER!!**
THIS BOT IS LITERALLY JUST THE CODE, YOU WILL NEED TO GET YOUR OWN TOKEN, YOUR OWN CHANNEL ID, 
AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOST IT AND MAKE IT CONFIGURABLE. THIS IS JUST A STUPID BOT TO MESS AROUND WITH! 
YOU WILL HAVE TO RUN THE CODE EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO USE IT. (In it's current state)

__**HOW TO USE**__

**Prerequisites:**

*--Python 3.11.3*

*--Some sort of code or text editor, (i reccommend VSCode)*

*--[discord.py]([url](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) installed*

*--A discord bot token* 





**Setup**

1: Go to the discord developer portal and create a new bot by clicking "NEW APPLICATION" name it, etc.. Then go to the 'Bot' tab and turn on all 'Privileged Gateway Intents'

Thats how it should look.

In the 'bot' tab, click on reset token and copy that token, save that for later. (**DO NOT SHARE THIS CODE**) 

After that, go to the 'OAuth2' Tab and look at the 'OAuth2 URL Generator' , check the 'bot' box on the first dialouge, when the second dialouge option pops up, check the 'Send Messages' box 
and then copy the code and open it in your web browser. And invite the bot to the server of your choice (one you own)

2: In the server the bot is in, choose the text channel you want the bot to be in, and then left click it. Click the 'Copy Channel ID' Button, and save this code for later, too.

3: Open the "CS" folder. you will see `Lists.txt` and `main.py`, `Lists.txt` is the list of fortnite quotes and `main.py` is the python script. 
It's currently small (5.28.24) but i plan on updating it as i go along. 

4: Open main.py in your text editor and put in your bot token (DO NOT REMOVE THE QUOTATION MARKS)

Then add your channel ID

**Now.. you should be done!** 
List of commands : 

?forgnite --random quote from `Lists.txt`

?helpme --help command , tells you the previous command 

?todo --todo list i forgot to remove, it's what i want to do for my personal quote bot
